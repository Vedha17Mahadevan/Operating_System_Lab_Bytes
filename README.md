3. Menu Driven Calculator using case (EXPT2)
   
4. Fork Basics part 1
   
5. Fork Basics part 2

6. Fork Basics part 3

7. Fork Basics part 4

8. Interprocess Communication Using Pipes Basics

9. Interprocess Communication Using Pipes (EXPT 3) : Write a program that creates a multi-stage pipeline with two child processes. The parent process sends a list of integers to the first child through Pipe1. The first child receives the numbers and squares each integer and pipes the result to the second child through Pipe2, which calculates the sum of all values and sends it back to the parent through Pipe3.

10. Shared Memory Basics part 1

11. Shared Memory Basics part 2

12. Interprocess Communication Using Shared Memory (EXPT 4) : Simulate a simple chat application between two process using shared memory. The parent process sends messages to the child and the child replies using shared memory.

13. CPU Scheduling Algorithm (EXPT 5) : Simulate the following non-pre-emptive CPU scheduling algorithms to find turnaround time and waiting time. a) FCFS b) SJF c) Round Robin (preemptive) d) Priority.

14. Bankers Algorithm (EXPT 6) : Implement the Banker’s algorithm for deadlock avoidance.

15. Producer Consumer using Semaphores (EXPT 7) : Implement the producer-consumer problem using semaphores.

16. Dining Philosopher's Problem (EXPT 8) : Write a program to simulate the working of the Dining Philosopher’s Problem

17. Page Replacement Algorithm (EXPT 9) : Simulate the following page replacement algorithms : a) FIFO b) LRU c) LFU

18. Disk Scheduling Algorithm (EXPT 10) : Simulate the following disk scheduling algorithms. a) FCFS b) SSTF c)SCAN d) C-SCAN
